            <p class="paragraph1 col-xs-7"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;">Magnus Carlsen is an extraordinary Chess Champion who can play at the level of the best chess computers. He has achieved true skill and the potential to possibly be the greatest chess player that has ever existed. His memory far surpasses anyone of us ordinary people, or to him, percieved sub-humans or merely stupid people. His wit is comparable with that of Stephen Hawing and Albert Einstein, he has an iq of arond 200.<br><br>His memory is astonding, he can play 10 games all whilst being blind folded. He is chess prodigy belittling the feats of the braniac chess chess champions before him. He has defeted GrandMasters without even looking at the board, all he does is say his move hears his opponents and eventually beats them. He has played with a pitiful 30 seconds on the clock while his opponents had upto 5 minutes to think. The results were in his favour. Such speed and wit of the ind is incomparable to any other mind.</span></strong></p>
